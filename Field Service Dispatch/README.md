## Project Overview

### Summary

The **Real-Time Field Service Dispatch Optimization** project is a cloud-based solution developed for **Skills Horizon** within the **service sector**, leveraging **Salesforce programming and declarative development**.  

This application automates the dispatch of field service technicians based on:  
- **Real-time location**  
- **Skill set**  
- **Workload balance**  

**Primary goal:**  
Optimize field service efficiency, reduce manual workloads, and improve customer satisfaction.  

---

### Problem Statement

The manual dispatch process for field service technicians is **inefficient and error-prone**, leading to delays and missed opportunities.  

Challenges include:  
- Lack of **real-time visibility** into technician availability and location  
- Difficulty aligning **skills to service needs**  
- Manual workload balancing across teams  
- Reduced customer satisfaction due to delays  

---

### Challenges Faced

- Integration of **real-time location and traffic data sources**  
- Visibility into **technician availability & workload distribution**  
- Ensuring **data security & compliance** when handling technician info  
- Developing **complex logic** for dispatch optimization across multiple factors  

---

## Project Contributions

Key contributions and deliverables:  
- Conducted **stakeholder interviews** with Service Managers, Dispatchers, and Field Technicians  
- Documented the **manual dispatch process** and identified pain points  
- Defined required data points (technician location, skill certifications, availability)  
- Created **process flow diagrams** for the automated dispatch system  
- Developed **Custom Metadata Types** and **Platform Events** for dispatch logic  
- Implemented **error handling & logging frameworks** for reliability  
- Built a **Dispatch Console Lightning Web Component (LWC)** for dispatchers  
- Configured the **technician mobile app** for real-time updates in the field  
- Prepared **unit test plans & UAT** to validate system readiness  

---

## Expected Outcomes

The project aims to:  
- Optimize dispatching using **real-time location, skills, and workload**  
- Improve **dispatcher-technician communication**  
- Enhance **service delivery efficiency**  
- Implement **robust error handling** to ensure reliability  
- Deliver actionable **reports & dashboards** for service managers  

---

## Features of Salesforce Used

- **Apex, Triggers, and Test Classes**  
- **Lightning Web Components (LWC)** for dispatcher console and technician UI  
- **Platform Events** (e.g., `Work_Order_Dispatch_Request__e`, `Dispatch_Success__e`, `Dispatch_Failure__e`)  
- **Custom Metadata Types** (API credentials, dispatch rules)  
- **Flows** for event-driven orchestration  
- **Security Configurations:** Profiles, Permission Sets, Roles  
- **Reports & Dashboards** for analytics  
- **Approval Processes & Validation Rules** for data integrity
