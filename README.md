**Introduction**

This repository provides a structured starting point for managing Salesforce projects using Jira as the central project tracking tool. The attached **Jira Import CSV** files include pre-defined **Epics, User Stories, and Tasks/Work Items** drawn from a collection of **capstone and keystone projects** that I have completed. These files showcase practical, real-world project structures that can be directly appliedâ€”or adaptedâ€”to new Salesforce initiatives.

In Salesforce development, it is easy to lose track of requirements, dependencies, and progress if tasks are managed informally. By leveraging Jira, teams can break down complex work into Epics, organize development activities into User Stories, and track detailed work items or tasks. This structured approach helps ensure accountability, visibility, and alignment across the project lifecycle. Each milestone of development on the Salesforce Org can be directly tied back to a Jira item, allowing progress to be updated and monitored in real time.
The provided CSV import files are formatted for straightforward use in Jira. When importing, create a new **SCRUM-type project** and **map the fields** according to Jiraâ€™s CSV import guidelines (see official Jira documentation for detailed instructions). Once imported, the project will immediately populate with a well-organized backlog, ready for sprint planning, prioritization, and execution.

This setup benefits both new developers, who may need a guided method for tackling a Salesforce project from start to finish, and seasoned developers, who may want to revisit agile best practices, experiment with new techniques, or practice structured project delivery.

**Key benefits include:**

  - A clear roadmap for Salesforce project execution.
  - Ready-to-use examples based on completed capstone and keystone projects.
  - Agile workflows aligned with industry standards.
  - A method for tracking and updating work items as development progresses.
  - Greater collaboration and transparency across stakeholders.

Future updates will also include configuration files to further streamline project setup and integration with Salesforce environments.
